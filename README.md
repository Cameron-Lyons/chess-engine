  - Move validation with detailed error messages
  - Game state feedback and timing information
  - Support for simple pawn moves (e4, d5) and captures (exd5)

## Building the Engine

### Prerequisites
- C++23 compatible compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 16+, or recent MSVC)
- Make

### Compilation
```bash
# Build the engine
make

# Clean build
make clean

# Build with debug information
make debug

# Build optimized release version
make release
```

## Running the Engine

```bash
# Run the chess engine
./chess_engine

# Or use make
make run
```

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**: The engine starts with the standard chess position. You play as White, the computer plays as Black.

2. **Making Moves**: Enter moves in algebraic notation:
   - `e4` - Simple pawn move to e4
   - `d5` - Simple pawn move to d5
   - `exd5` - Pawn capture from e-file to d5
   - `Nf3` - Knight move to f3
   - `O-O` - Kingside castle (if legal)
   - `O-O-O` - Queenside castle (if legal)

3. **Game Flow**:
   - You enter your move
   - The engine validates the move
   - If valid, the move is executed and the board is updated
   - The computer calculates and makes its move using evaluation-based move selection
   - The process repeats until checkmate or stalemate

4. **Ending the Game**: Type `quit` or `exit` to end the game early.
